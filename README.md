# Meteor UP - Stage

Production quality Meteor Deployments with Capistrano-like staged configurations which live
in your project for more concise and simple management.

Built atop [Meteor UP](https://github.com/arunoda/meteor-up) by @arunoda.


#### Production Quality Meteor Deployments

Meteor Up (mup for short) is a command line tool that allows you to deploy any meteor app into your own server. It supports Ubuntu 12.04 or higher servers from any Cloud Infrastructure Provider.

### Features

* Single command server setup
* Single command deployment
* Environmental Variables management
* Support for [`settings.json`](http://docs.meteor.com/#meteor_settings)
* Password or Private Key(pem) based server authentication
* Access, logs from the terminal (supports log tailing)
* Support for multiple meteor deployments

### Server Configuration

* Auto-Restart if the app crashed (using forever)
* Auto-Start after the server reboot (using upstart)
* Stepdown User Privileges
* Revert to the previous version, if the deployment failed
* Support for **Hot Code Reload**
* Secured MongoDB Installation (Optional)
* Pre-Installed PhantomJS (Optional)

### Installation

    npm install -g mup

If you are looking for password based authentication, you need to [install sshpass](https://gist.github.com/arunoda/7790979) on your local development machine.

### Creating a Meteor Up Project

    mkdir ~/my-meteor-deployment
    cd ~/my-meteor-deployment
    mup init

This will create two files in your Meteor Up project directory, which are:

  * mup.json - Meteor Up configuration file
  * settings.json - Settings for Meteor's [settings API](http://docs.meteor.com/#meteor_settings)

`mup.json` is commented and easy to follow (it supports JavaScript comments)

### Example File

```js
{
  //server authentication info
  "servers": [
    {
      "host": "123.456.789.012",
      "username": "root",
      "password": "x7fj29dhs0",
      "sshOptions": { "Port" : 49154 },
      //or pem file (ssh based authentication)
      //"pem": "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
    }
  ],

  //install MongoDB in the server, does not destroy local mongo db on future setup
  "setupMongo": true,
  
  //WARNING: Nodejs is required! Only skip if you already have nodejs installed on server.
  "setupNode": true,
  
  //WARNING: If nodeVersion omitted will setup 0.10.25 by default. Do not use v, only version number.
  "nodeVersion": "0.10.25",
  
  //install PhantomJS in the server
  "setupPhantom": true,

  //application name
  "appName": "meteor",

  //location of app (local directory)
  "app": "/Users/arunoda/Meteor/my-app",

  //configure environmental
  "env": {
    "PORT": 80,
    "ROOT_URL": "http://myapp.com",
    "MONGO_URL": "mongodb://arunoda:fd8dsjsfh7@hanso.mongohq.com:10023/MyApp",
    "MAIL_URL": "smtp://postmaster%40myapp.mailgun.org:adj87sjhd7s@smtp.mailgun.org:587/"
  },

  //meteor-up checks if the app comes online just after the deployment
  //before mup checks that, it will wait for no. of seconds configured below
  "deployCheckWaitTime": 15
}
```

### Setting Up a Server

    mup setup

This will setup the server for the mup deployments. It will take around 2-5 minutes depending on the server's performance and network availability.

#### Server Setup Details

This is how Meteor Up will configure the server for you based on the given appName or using "meteor" as default appName. This information will help you to customize server for your needs.

* your app is lives in `/opt/<appName>/app`
* mup uses upstart with a config file at `/etc/init/<appName>.conf`
* you can start and stop the app with upstart: `start <appName>` and `stop <appName>`
* logs are located at: `/var/log/upstart/app.log`
* MongoDB installed and bind to the local interface (cannot access from the outside)
* `<appName>` is the name of the database

For more information see [`lib/taskLists.js`](https://github.com/arunoda/meteor-up/blob/master/lib/taskLists.js).

### Deploying an App

    mup deploy

This will bundle the meteor project and deploy it to the server.

#### Deploy Wait Time

Meteor-Up checks for if the deployment is successful or not just after the deployment. By default, it will wait 10 seconds before the check. You can configure the wait time with `deployCheckWaitTime` option in the `mup.json`

#### Multiple Deployment Targets

You can use an array to deploy to multiple servers at once. 

To deploy to *different* environments (e.g. staging, production, etc.), use separate Meteor Up configurations in separate directories, with each directory containing separate `mup.json` and `settings.json` files, and the `mup.json` files' `app` field pointing back to your app's local directory. 

#### Custom Meteor Binary

Sometime, you might be using Meteor from a git checkout or using `mrt`. By default Meteor Up uses `meteor`. You can ask Meteor Up to use the correct binary with `meteorBinary` option.

~~~js
{
  ...
  "meteorBinary": "~/bin/meteor/meteor"
  ...
}
~~~

### Access Logs

    mup logs -f

Mup can tail logs from the server and it supports all the options of `tail`

### Reconfiguring & Restarting

After you've edit environmental variables or settings.json, you can reconfigure the app without deploying again. Use following command for that.

    mup reconfig

This will also restart the app, so you can use it for that purpose even if you didn't change the configuration file. 

### Multiple Deployments

Meteor Up supports multiple deployments into a single server. Meteor up only does the deployment; if you need to configure subdomains, you need to manually setup a reverse proxy yourself.

Let's assume, we need to deploy a production and the staging versions of the app into the same server. Production App runs on the PORT 80 and staging app run on PORT 8000.

We need to have two seperate Meteor Up Projects. For that create two directories and initialize Meteor UP and add neccessory configurations.

In the staging configurations add a field called `appName` with the value `staging` into the `mup.json`. You can add any name you prefer instead of `staging`. Since we are running our staging app in port 8000, add an environment variable called `PORT` with the value 3000.

Now setup both projects and deploy as you need.

### Binary NPM Modules

If you are using binary npm modules either with meteor-npm or with some other package you can't deploy and run your app by default. That's because, binaries in the bundle are not compatible with your deployment environment.

So, you need to specify binary modules and which packages are then as shown below in your `mup.json`.

~~~json
{
  ...

  "binaryNpmModules": {
    "meteor-package-name": ["npm-module1", "npm-module2"]
  } 

  ...
}
~~~
